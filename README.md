# Price Per Unit Comparison Calculator

This is very much a work-in-progress as I learn and explore concepts in React. [Josh Comeau's](https://twitter.com/JoshWComeau) excellent [Joy of React](https://www.joyofreact.com/) course has been a fantastic guide along the way. Implementation choices, assumptions and "footguns" are all mine and do not reflect the direction or intent of the course instructor.

Accepting proposals for a less terrible name. So far I've got:

- Price Per Unit Comparison Calculator
- PPUCC
- PPU4U&ME
- Price Pal
- Unit Converter
- Unit Buddy
- What's That Cost?
